To Improve & Focus on:

	-> Dp problem solving skills.
	-> Graph problem solving skills.
	-> Learn New Data Structures.
	-> String Algorithms.
	-> Keep improving Math skills.
	-> Number theory + Counting + probability.
	-> Problem solving approach.


Codechef Long Challenge:
	
	Pros:
		-> Do not under-estimate Codechef Long Challenge.
		-> Its really a good platform to improve your Maths skills,problem solving abilities.
		-> Improves the approach to the solution.
		-> Also improves implementation skills.

	Tasks:
		-> Give your best for 10 days,it doesn't matter how many you solve in a contest.
		-> Do atleast 3 long contests.



Codeforces:
	
	Pro's:
		-> Very good place to improve your math skills,graph theory,implementation,data structures.
		-> Place to learn new data structures.

	Tasks:
		-> Take part in as many contests as possible.
		-> Don't concentrate much on rating.
		-> In the end what matters is how much you have learnt,not the rating.
		-> In a contest,You should be able to do 4 div-2 problems easily by the end of 6th sem.
		-> Practise well on this uring your leisure.


Spoj:
	
	Pro's:
		-> Good place to learn classic problems.
		-> Place to learn new data structures.

	Tasks:
		-> Try Crossing 150 problems by the end of 6th sem.
		-> Learn new data structures from this.


Topcoder:
	
	Tasks:
		-> Master Dp and problem solving skills from this.
